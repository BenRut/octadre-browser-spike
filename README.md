# Octadre for Browsers

An attempt to refactor  
[Octadre](https://github.com/rafapaezbas/octadre) into a stripped down browser version.

Octadre is a an interface/sequencer for Novation Launchpad. This is an attempt to refactor the code to work in a limited capacity within the browser for demonstration purposes in order to promote the product to those who donâ€™t own a Novation Launchpad.

**Work In Progress**
